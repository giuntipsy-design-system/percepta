    <p class="overview-lead">
      Percepta defines how design decisions are translated into production-ready UI.
      It connects design intent to frontend implementation through tokens, shared components,
      and documented usage patterns, ensuring consistency across products.
    </p>
    <p class="overview-lead">
      Rather than styling interfaces ad hoc, Percepta establishes a layered system where
      responsibilities are clearly separated and changes are controlled.

        Percepta does not define brand or visual strategy.

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3 class="docs-h2">Technical overview</h3>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta is built around three core layers:
      </p>
      <h4 class="docs-h3">Design tokens</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Design tokens are the single source of truth for:
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Colors</li>
        <li>Typography</li>
        <li>Spacing</li>
        <li>Border radius</li>
        <li>Interaction states</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Tokens are defined once and compiled into Sass, then consumed by shared components.
        Application code should never hardcode these values.
      </p>
      <h4 class="docs-h3">Shared components</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Shared Angular components (for example buttons, inputs, and icons) are the primary
        integration point for applications.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">Components:</p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Consume tokens</li>
        <li>Encode interaction behavior</li>
        <li>Expose a stable API to consuming apps</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        This ensures that visual and behavioral changes are centralized and predictable.
      </p>
      <h4 class="docs-h3">Documentation</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        The documentation site is built using the same shared components.
        What you see in the docs is the real implementation, not mock examples.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">Documentation exists to:</p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Explain usage and intent</li>
        <li>Define interaction contracts</li>
        <li>Prevent misinterpretation at application level.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="docs-h3">Layout responsibility</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta separates component behavior from documentation layout.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Shared components (`gp-*`) are layout-agnostic. They do not center themselves,
        define widths, or control page alignment. Components are designed to behave
        correctly in any context and must not include layout assumptions.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        All layout decisions related to centering, spacing, or presentation live
        exclusively in the documentation layer.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        In this documentation, components may appear centered or constrained for
        clarity. This is handled by documentation wrappers and is not part of the
        component implementation.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Components should never manage their own layout.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h3 class="docs-h2">Technology scope</h3>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta is designed to be technology-agnostic at design system level.
        Design tokens, interaction rules, and component intent are defined independently of any specific framework.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        The current implementation uses Angular and PrimeNG as the primary frontend stack, but this represents one
        concrete implementation, not a limitation of the system.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        The same tokens and component definitions can be consumed by other technologies or frameworks by providing
        an appropriate implementation layer.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h3 class="docs-h2">PrimeNG integration</h3>
      <p class="docs-body">
        PrimeNG provides the structural primitives used by Percepta components.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">Percepta:</p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Reuses PrimeNG component structure</li>
        <li>Overrides styles, tokens, and interaction behavior where needed</li>
        <li>Avoids forking or reimplementing base components</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        This approach balances development speed with design control, while staying aligned
        with Angular best practices.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h3 class="docs-h2">Design → Code workflow</h3>
      <ol class="docs-list">
        <li>A design decision is defined and validated in the design reference</li>
        <li>The decision is translated into design tokens</li>
        <li>Tokens are consumed by shared Angular components</li>
        <li>Components and tokens are documented in this repository</li>
        <li>Applications consume components without redefining styles</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="docs-body">
        This ensures that changes propagate consistently and intentionally.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h3 class="docs-h2">Governance &amp; contribution</h3>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta evolves through controlled changes to tokens and shared components.
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Proposals can be raised by the frontend team</li>
        <li>Changes are reviewed before merging</li>
        <li>Documentation is updated alongside code changes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        A breaking change is any modification that:
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Alters a component API</li>
        <li>Changes the meaning of an existing token</li>
        <li>Modifies interaction behavior in a way that affects consuming applications</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Breaking changes should be clearly documented and communicated.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">Use the project issue tracker to:</p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Report bugs</li>
        <li>Propose improvements</li>
        <li>Discuss potential changes before implementation.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content-block">
      <p class="docs-body">
        Applications should consume Percepta components and tokens directly,
        rather than redefining UI styles locally.
