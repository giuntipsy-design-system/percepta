        Tokens are the single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, and states. They are
        compiled and consumed by shared Angular components.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        PrimeNG provides the base primitives. Percepta reuses their structure and overrides styles,
        tokens, and behaviors where needed.

      <h3 class="docs-h2">Governance &amp; contribution</h3>
      <p class="docs-body">
        The system evolves through controlled changes to tokens and shared components. Changes can be
        proposed by the frontend team and reviewed before merging.
      </p>
      <p class="docs-body">
        A breaking change alters component API, token meaning, or behavior in a way that requires
        updates in consuming apps. Use the project issue tracker to report bugs or propose improvements.
