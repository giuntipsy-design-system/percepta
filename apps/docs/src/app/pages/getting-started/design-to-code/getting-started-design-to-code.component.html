    <h2>How Percepta works</h2>
    <p>
      Percepta connects design decisions to production UI through tokens, shared components,
      and documented usage patterns.

      This repo only documents technical implementation.

    <h3 class="docs-h3">Technical overview</h3>
    <p>
      Tokens are the single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, and states. They are
      compiled and consumed by shared Angular components.
    </p>
    <p>
      PrimeNG provides the base primitives. Percepta reuses their structure and overrides styles,
      tokens, and behaviors where needed.

    <ol class="docs-list">
      <li>Design decision is made in the design reference.</li>
      <li>Decision is translated into tokens in this repo.</li>
      <li>Tokens are used by Angular components and documentation.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="docs-h3">Governance &amp; contribution</h3>
    <p>
      The system evolves through controlled changes to tokens and shared components. Changes can be
      proposed by the frontend team and reviewed before merging.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breaking change alters component API, token meaning, or behavior in a way that requires
      updates in consuming apps. Use the project issue tracker to report bugs or propose improvements.
