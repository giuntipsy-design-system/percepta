    <p>
      Percepta is the technical layer that turns design decisions into tokens, shared components,
      and documentation. It keeps UI implementation consistent across products.

    <h3 class="docs-h3">What it solves</h3>
    <p>
      It reduces drift between design and code, standardizes UI behaviors, and provides a single
      source of truth for frontend implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frontend engineers building with Angular and PrimeNG.
