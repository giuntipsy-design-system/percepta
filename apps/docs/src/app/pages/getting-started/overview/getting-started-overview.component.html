        Percepta is the design system implementation layer for Giunti Psychometrics.
        This repository documents how design decisions are translated into code, including tokens,
        shared UI components, and canonical documentation.
      </p>
      <p class="overview-lead">
        It is intended to be the single reference point for frontend implementation, ensuring
        consistency, scalability, and long-term maintainability across products.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Overview</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Percepta bridges the gap between design intent and frontend execution.
      It defines a structured system of design tokens, reusable Angular components, and documented
      interaction patterns that can be reliably consumed by applications.
    </p>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Rather than prescribing visual styles ad hoc, Percepta establishes a contract between design
      and code: design decisions are encoded once and reused everywhere.
    </p>
    <div class="content-block">
      <h4 class="docs-h3">What Percepta solves</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta addresses common problems in large UI codebases:
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Reduces drift between design and implementation over time</li>
        <li>Standardizes UI behavior, spacing, typography, and interaction states</li>
        <li>Avoids duplication and custom styling at application level</li>
        <li>Provides a clear, shared source of truth for frontend teams</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        By centralizing these decisions, Percepta enables teams to move faster without sacrificing consistency.

    <div class="content-block">
      <h4 class="docs-h3">Who this is for</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        This documentation is primarily intended for:
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Frontend engineers working on Giunti Psychometrics products</li>
        <li>Teams building interfaces with Angular and PrimeNG</li>
        <li>Developers consuming shared components and tokens</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Designers may also find this useful as a reference for how design decisions are realized in code.

      <h4 class="docs-h3">Platforms and technologies</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Percepta is currently built on:
      </p>
      <ul class="docs-list">
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>PrimeNG</li>
        <li>Sass-based design tokens</li>
      </ul>

        The system is designed to be technology-aware but not technology-bound, allowing future extensions if needed.

        This repository focuses on implementation, not on defining brand or visual strategy.

      <h4 class="docs-h3">How to use this documentation</h4>
      <p class="docs-body">
        Start by reviewing the token foundations, then explore shared components.
        Application code should consume Percepta components and tokens directly, rather than redefining styles locally.
