    <h2 class="docs-h1">Accessibility</h2>
    <p class="overview-lead">
      Accessibility in Percepta starts with design decisions, not with technical fixes.
      It is not an additional step applied at the end of the process, but a way of thinking
      embedded in how interfaces are structured, labeled, and explained.
    </p>
    <p class="overview-lead">
      Design choices such as hierarchy, clarity, spacing, and feedback have a direct impact
      on accessibility. These decisions are made every day by designers and developers,
      long before code-level considerations come into play.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Accessibility as a design and development mindset</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Percepta treats accessibility as an integral part of the design and development process.
      It is considered from the first sketches and wireframes through to implementation and
      iteration.
    </p>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Designers establish clear structure, intent, and language.
      Developers ensure that these decisions are implemented correctly and consistently.
      Accessibility emerges from this continuous collaboration, not from isolated fixes.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Shared responsibility</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Accessibility in Percepta is a shared responsibility between the design system,
      the underlying framework, and the teams building the product.
    </p>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Percepta defines semantic structure, usage patterns, and visual consistency.
      The framework provides keyboard interaction, focus management, and ARIA behavior.
      Product teams are responsible for context, content, and correct implementation.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Notes on compliance</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Percepta aims to support compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG.
      However, compliance depends on correct usage and context-specific implementation
      within each product.
