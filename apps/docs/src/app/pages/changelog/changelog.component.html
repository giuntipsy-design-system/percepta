    <p class="overview-lead">
      The Percepta changelog documents the evolution of the design system.
      It focuses on system-level milestones, component maturity, and design
      decisions, rather than individual commits or technical releases.
    </p>
    <p class="overview-lead">
      Percepta is under active development. Changes are introduced incrementally
      and documented as the system grows.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">February 10, 2026 · First evolutionary baseline</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      This release reflects the current state of the Percepta site and establishes the first
      consolidated baseline of the design system, documentation, and VOL product prototypes.
      It is the reference point for future incremental updates.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Initial system foundation</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      The first iteration of Percepta establishes the core principles, structure,
      and interaction model of the design system.
    <br />This foundation sets the stage for consistent component
      development and documentation going forward.
      This milestone focuses on defining a consistent foundation for form controls,
      interaction patterns, and documentation standards.
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-h3">Included in this milestone</h4>
    <ul class="docs-list">
      <li>Definition of system-owned vs framework-owned components.</li>
      <li>Canonical documentation structure for components.</li>
      <li>Semantic interaction mapping across form controls.</li>
      <li>Consistent usage, states, and accessibility guidelines.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="section doc-card">
    <h3 class="docs-h2">Form controls family completed</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      The initial set of form controls is now documented and aligned under a shared
      interaction and semantic model.
    </p>
    <h4 class="docs-h3">Components included</h4>
    <ul class="docs-list">
      <li>Input</li>
      <li>Textarea</li>
      <li>Select</li>
      <li>Radio Button</li>
      <li>Checkbox</li>
      <li>Switch</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Each component follows the same documentation pattern and clearly defines
      when to use it, how it behaves, and how it differs from related controls.

    <h3 class="docs-h2">Notes on stability</h3>
    <p class="docs-body">
      At this stage, Percepta components are considered stable in terms of behavior
      and usage guidelines. Visual refinements and additional components may be
      introduced incrementally.
    </p>
    <p class="docs-body">
      Breaking changes are unlikely but may occur as the system evolves.
      Such changes will be explicitly documented in future entries.
